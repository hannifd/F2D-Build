        <li>Visual acuity is the sharpness of your vision. By law, you must be able to read a standard number plate from a distance of 20 metres with glasses or corrective lenses if worn. In addition, the visual acuity must be at least Snellen 6/12 (decimal 0.5) with both eyes open, or in the only functioning eye if monocular. If you do not meet this standard you must not drive on a public road as you would be committing an offence.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>You should regularly check for yourself that you can read a number plate from the required distance and discuss your visual acuity with your optician/eyesight specialist at each appointment to ensure you meet this standard. If your GP or optician/eye specialist says you do not meet this standard (with correction if required), you must either surrender your licence or notify us of the change by completing a further eyesight notification questionnaire.</li>
